    Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone
    into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he
    better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?

    Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in
    a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't
    belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to
    your dumb ass.

    Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how
    you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're
    friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They
    called me Mr Glass.

    You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world
    once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly
    when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now
    we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it
    wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

    Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
    it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical
    helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must
    think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.

    Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine.
    You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water.
    We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are
    connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

    Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun
    in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the
    most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.

    My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
    someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
    the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to
    you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
    motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

    Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to
    the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows.
    Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the
    ones that became nothing.
